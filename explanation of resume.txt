1. Around  5 years of working experience in the IT industry as Machine Learning & Data Engineer.

           I have developed around four projects that are involving building machine Learning
           models and deep learning models. 


                pytesseract, google vision
                for extracting the text
            
            and the text will be processed further.

            part of speach

            
            nltk 
            spacy 
            sparknlp

document  parsing  steps:



    1.  we are extracting the text images
    2.  doing the text preprocessing such as part of speech tagging,
        text normalisation                          stemming, (removing prefixes)
                                                    lemmatisation ()
    3. text labelling   dataturks tools
        object labelling such as persons and objects 
                    labelIMG

            we get trainable data


            train and test

            we 

                and then test


    4. we have text with labels in a json format
        customer named entity models
