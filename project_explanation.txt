Steps:

    1. We convert any document to images.

        if the file is a pdf,doc,docx,rtf document,
        then we convert it into image format.

        we use packages such as pdf2image, docx2pdf

In this tutorial, Iâ€™m going to show how to use OCR for Document Parsing. 
I will present some useful Python code that can be easily used in other 
similar cases (just copy, 
paste, run) and walk through every line of code with comments, 
so that you can easily replicate this example 
(link to the full code below).
