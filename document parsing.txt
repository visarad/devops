pdf , doc, rtf  extracting these applications is some what easier.

but extract the textual data from images ,jpg,tiff,png, it is very difficult.

SO in order to extract the data from images, we use ocr techniques.

optical character recognition.(OCR)


package :  PYTESSERACT 

    image processing

            like removing the noise such blurred,
                dark images, resize, tilted image


                computer vision                             natural language processing

             jpeg tiff png bitmap etc 

             pytesseract, 

             detection          we label text using some labelling tools.
                                here ,we get the co-ordinates of the text and label the data



            model is built based on features{size of house, no of rooms, built condition
                            } and targets{prices}


            some observations   have labels

                insurance doc     
             
             cnns
            
40 labels

           start     end    first name

traning data 

     doc1       10,10   20, 10     aman        
     doc2      9,12,   19,12       bajwa    
        .
        .
        .
        .
    doc100             

using the training data
you develop a model which is nothing but a mathematical function

labelling or tagging, annotating 


test
     doc1    x,y    x1,y     firstname         x20 ,y,  x30,y   last name ...... 40 elements labeled
     doc2          

based on metrics you come to know that how the model is performing

        if the model is not performing well then you have to retrain
        (performance tuning)
        or do more image collection, more image preprocessing, image
        augmentation


y = m1 x1+m2 x2+ m3 * x3


x1,x2,x3 = size of house, no of rooms, location  these all features
m1,m1,m3 = parameters
y are targets or labels
